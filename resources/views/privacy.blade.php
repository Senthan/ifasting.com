                                    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following
                                        applies:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note:
                                            Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data
                                            until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to
                                            rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however,
                                            does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to
                                            European data protection law;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the
                                            User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                                        </li>
                                        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the

                                        </li>
                                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest
                                            or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;

                                        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                                            by the Owner or by a third party.

                                        applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
                                        Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
                                        enter into a contract. </p>
